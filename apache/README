-------------------------
The Django project has nicely documented the procedure for deploying django on apache w/ mod_wsgi (the recommended way for production)

http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/modwsgi/

After reading the docs, the below information should help jump-start getting django-beacon into production on apache

# DJANGO/BEACON production settings.py
For production, it is suggested that you set the following variables in beacon/settings.py:

    BASE_DIRECTORY = '/path/to/your/beacon/' # path to your beacon folder (ie the one with settings.py, manage.py, etc in it)
    DEBUG = False
    USE_I18N = False

# VHOST CONFIG
example-beacon-vhost.conf:

    drop this virtual host configuration into your apache folder and modify paths appropriately (read comments for details)

# WSGI CONFIG
django.wsgi:

    configure this file with the correct paths (read comments for details)

# BEACON JS CONFIG

    For production, you will also need to modify beacon/media/beacon/beacon.conf with the correct url to beacon
