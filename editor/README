Beacon v0.2
~~~~~~~~~~~

The AJAXian WYSIWYG Editor for GuideXML.

Requirements:
    - PHP 5.1+ (on any web server ;))
    - Javascript enabled on: Firefox, Opera or Camino (No Mozilla, Konqueror or Safari yet, sorry! There are _NO_ plans to make this work on IE!)

Check the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

Once you are ready to go, usage is just too easy:

    - Choose to either create a new document or edit an existing one.
    - Toolbox contains GuideXML elements that you can add
    - Click on an area to edit it, then click save when you are done.

What CAN'T you do yet (but will be able to soon enough ;)):

    - Edit <book> based GuideXML documents
    - Delete or re-order GuideXML elements within the document.

Feel free to contact me at: <anant@kix.in> if you have any suggestions,
comments or would like to help with the project.
