Beacon v0.1
~~~~~~~~~~~

Installation is a no-brainer. No web-server writeable directories required. 
Just copy the `editor' folder to your `htdocs' directory. Make sure you
change the $confurl variable in the `conf' file to point to the correct
location of the `editor' directory on your webserver.

You're all good to go!
