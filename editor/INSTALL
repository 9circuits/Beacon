~~~~~~~~~~~

Installation is a no-brainer. 

1. Just copy the `editor' folder to your `htdocs' directory. 

2. Make sure you change the $confurl variable in the `conf' file to point to the correct location of the `editor' directory on your webserver.

3. Get a snack.

4. Point your browser to the editor folder (eg. http://youdomainname.com/editor/)

5. You're all good to go!
