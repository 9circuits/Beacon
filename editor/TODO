TODO (As on 19th April, 2009)

- See the code and inline comments on most of the TODOs

A few are:

1. Complete the GuideXML plugin
2. Make an API for plugin development
 - This API should handle tasks like creating UI elements and using the core Beacon functions through an abstraction. (Come to #beacon (freenode) for more discussions on this)
3. Avoid Javascript based page layout. Get a CSS solution working.
4. Plug in the storage API in the new framework.
