1. Put the beacon directory in your web server folder at your desired location.

2. Open beacon.conf and give the settings appropriately. For help on the settings open beacon.conf.sample to see what each setting is about.

3. Point your browser to the URL given in the conf file.

4. You are done! Currently the guidexml plugin allows editing only in simple source view and the changes can be seen right back in the design view.
